## On Writing

This blog post is about how to think about writing and how to really do it.

> Practice makes perfect

You might hear about this quote, it could be applied to all the things we're doing, especially writing. But what makes practice "practicible" ?

Here's my thought and understanding on the topic.

Firstly, to me, the first thing to think about it is that you DON'T need a TOPIC to really write. There is a topic on LEARNING TREE, which is a decision game tree, in which the root is the core knowledge, people then create knowledge branches from it, and then go on. After that, the brain needs to refresh again to remove fruitless branch, you might think of any of relaxing activities to do it.

Secondly, you need a concept. I mean the roadmap which resists inside your mind when writing. You don't be afraid of mistakes. You've got a tool called DICTIONAY, a really English-English dictionary, from which you could FEEL the meaning of the word, KNOW the correct word to express your thought, and BE READY when you need it. I recommend the online Oxford dictionary here.

Thirdly, you need a place to host your posts. Github is my choice, Markdown is my format, SublimeText is my editor. Then you just use a tool like Jekyll to host anywhere you want.

Bump!

Lastly, writing includes revision and development, so you puts it on Github makes perfect sense now. You could use it for this particular purpose or anything else.

Just keep in mind that, always make writing a habit. It's the first step and the hardest step now. 

Good luck to you.
